For the first 5 participats (which include this participant), we had a problem with the recording of the answer during recall. all the answered were recorded but the parsing of the data into the correct line was not optimal. The RoomQ_Modified, is the modified version pf the RoomQ.csv, with an "optimal" parsing.

Basically, in the orginal file, the data were recorded this way:

RoomQ1:
Value 0
RoomQ2: 
Value 1
Value 0
Value O
RoomQ1
RoomQ2

(The value for RoomQ1 where sometimes recorded in the line BEFORE the title Q1. We manually changed this in RoomQmodified, and we changed the experimental file for the other participants.
